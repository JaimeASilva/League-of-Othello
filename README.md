# League of Othello

Othello or Riversi was created in the XIX century and later became popular in England. It is a simple game between 2 players, each one choses a color (black or white) and the goal of the game is to have the most number of pieces of your color on the board. The game begins with four pieces placed in a square in the middle of the board, two white pieces, two black pieces, so that the same colored pieces are on a diagonal. The black pieces always play first. *Black* must place a piece on the board so that it creates at least one straight (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line between the new piece and another black piece, with one or more contiguous light pieces between them and the plays can only be made if you can change at least 1 oponnent piece into yours. The game can end in 2 ways, either the board is full of pieces or none of the players can make a move. In the case a player doesn't have a possible play and the other has, the player without the possibility of placing a piece must pass.
